      "analysis": "1. CURRENT PORTFOLIO ASSESSMENT:\n\nThe current portfolio is well-diversified across different stocks, which is a good strategy to mitigate risk for micro-cap investment. However, MVIS does not meet the micro-cap criteria as its market cap exceeds $300M. Therefore, it should be replaced with a micro-cap stock.\n\n2. MARKET OUTLOOK:\n\nThe market for micro-cap stocks is generally uncertain due to their inherent volatility and high risk. However, opportunities for high returns also exist. Factors such as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and global economic growth will affect the performance of these stocks. A cautious approach is recommended due to the remaining short time horizon.\n\n3. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:\n\n- MVIS: SELL. Confidence: HIGH. Although MVIS has been a weekly research candidate, its market cap is beyond the micro-cap range. The proceeds can be used to reinvest in a micro-cap stock.\n- REKR, DUOT, PDSB, TNXP, MIST, ALDX: HOLD. Confidence: MEDIUM. These stocks comply with the micro-cap criteria. Despite the market's inherent volatility, they should be held for potential return.\n\n4. NEW INVESTMENT THESIS:\n\nConsidering the market outlook and the portfolio constraints, a prudent approach would be to reinvest the proceeds from MVIS into a promising micro-cap stock with strong growth potential and financial strength. This would maintain the portfolio's diversification and align with the goal of maximizing return. \n\nNew potential stocks should be carefully researched considering their financial health, growth potential, and upcoming catalysts or concerns. The risk/reward ratio should be favorable and position size should align with risk management strategy. Monitoring these factors will be crucial in the remaining period of the experiment.",
